This project titled "AI Chemist" was created by Pratyush Jagtap as the part of a virtual internship program named "Google Cloud Generative AI". The purpose of this project is to mimic a chemist who is an expert on pharmaceuticals and medicines. As a final evaluation for mentioned intenrship program, this application was made.
In this project, I've used Gemini Flash 1.5 model due to its quick response and reliability while also providing a higher temperature for more insightful and user-friendly answers to user's prompts.
The web application is hosted on Streamlit which provides a simple layout UI. 
Evidently, the platform used for this web application is GeminiAI.
